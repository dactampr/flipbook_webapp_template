    		Dan-sensei!
    		
    		I hope your instinct to doublecheck your apprentice's work is paying off and you're reading this right now!
    		
    		I'm really bummed I couldn't be there for your last day. I hope no one made you endure any forced socialization.
    		
    		It's hard to really express how grateful I am for your intelligence, humor, and patience -- not just for the team,
    		but for me, personally. I've always learned best by looking over someone's shoulder -- it's the little sister in me,
    		I think. Drawing this comic, though, I thought about how annoying I probably was: breaking your concentration
    		on involved projectsto to ask what must've seemed like laughably obvious questions. Honestly, you could've just 
    		snarkily emailed "Google.com" to half of my questions. 
    		
    		But you never did -- you always stopped what you were doing, took off your headphones, and engaged with me and
    		my bootleg code. That wasn't your job; you didn't have to do that. PRH is a business, after all, not graduate
    		school. But you DID. So few people would be that helpful and selfless, with such understanding and grace.
    		
    		I'm so excited your talent is finally gonna get the recognition it deserves (and you're gonna get to run year-
    		round, whoooooo!). I'm going to miss you dearly at the office -- your sense of humor, your ability to crrrrush
    		a meeting with a single, incisive sentence, your expertise in ... everything. I've learned so much from you
    		that it takes some of the scariness out of your departure, but jeez, not having you sitting behind me
    		is going to feel like a phantom limb for a while.
    		
    		I promise to give your Wacom a good home and not to fuck up the Thunderbird repository too badly. I hope you and 
    		Christina LOVE California. I hope you eat as much ramen as you can possibly hold.
    		
    		Please (and I don't mean this in a fake way), please stay in touch.
    		
    		Forever the student,
    		Mary
